Being enthusiastic is worth 25 IQ points.

Prototype your life. Try stuff instead of making grand plans.

A worthy goal for a year is to learn enough about a subject so that you can’t believe how ignorant you were a year earlier.

You can’t reason someone out of a notion that they didn’t reason themselves into.

Treating a person to a meal never fails and is so easy to do. It’s powerful with old friends and a great way to make new friends.

Pain is inevitable. Suffering is optional.

If you are looking for something in your house and you finally find it when you’re done with it don’t put it back where you found it. Put it back where you first looked for it.

A great way to understand yourself is to seriously reflect on everything you find irritating in others.

The advantage of a ridiculously ambitious goal is that it sets the bar very high so even if your effort falls short it may exceed an ordinary success.

The best way to learn anything is to try to teach what you know.

Whenever you have a choice between being right or being kind be kind. No exceptions. Don’t confuse kindness with weakness.

Recipe for greatness: Become just a teeny bit better than you were last year. Repeat every year.

Whenever you can’t decide which path to take pick the one that produces change.

If you are the smartest person in the room, you are in the wrong room. Hang out with, and learn from people smarter than yourself. Even better, find smart people who will disagree with you.

Rule of 3 in conversation: To get to the real reason, ask a person to go deeper than what they just said. Then again, and then once more. The third time’s answer is the one closest to the truth.

Don’t be the best. Be the only.

Everyone is shy. Other people are waiting for you to introduce yourself to them; they are waiting for you to send them an email; they are waiting for you to ask them on a date. Go ahead.

The more you are interested in others the more interesting they’ll find you. To be interesting, be interested.

The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it. You just do it. Good habits can range from telling the truth to flossing.

If you ask for someone’s feedback you’ll get a critic. But if instead you ask for advice you’ll get a partner.

To move through a place you may not be permitted, act like you belong there.

Nothing elevates a person higher than taking responsibility for their mistakes. If you mess up, fess up. It’s astounding how powerful this ownership is.

Hatred is a curse that does not affect the hated. It only poisons the hater. Release a grudge as if it were a poison.

Separate the processes of creating from improving. You can’t write and edit or sculpt and polish or make and analyze at the same time. If you do, the editor stops the creator. While you invent, don’t select. While you sketch, don’t inspect. While you write the first draft, don’t reflect. At the start, the creator mind must be unleashed from judgment.

If you are not falling down occasionally you are just coasting.

Perhaps the most counterintuitive truth of the universe is that the more you give to others the more you’ll get. Understanding this is the beginning of wisdom.

Don’t be in haste. When you are in a hurry you are more easily conned or manipulated.

To cultivate a habit switch your language from “I can or can’t do” to “I do or don’t do.” You shift the weight from a wavering choice to an unwavering identity.

Acquiring things will rarely bring you deep satisfaction. But acquiring experiences will.

To earn bliss just for a moment send someone you don’t know a compliment for something they did.

When someone is nasty, hateful, or mean toward you treat their behavior like an affliction or illness they have. That makes it easier to have empathy toward them which can soften the conflict.

Don’t bother asking a barber if you need a haircut. Pay attention to incentives.

That thing that made you weird as a kid could make you great as an adult —if you don’t lose it.

Following your bliss is a recipe for paralysis if you don’t know what you are passionate about. A better path for most youth is “master something.” Through mastery of one thing you’ll command a viewpoint to steadily find where your bliss is.

Life gets better as you replace transactions with relationships.

If you are not embarrassed by your past self you have probably not grown up yet.

Outlaw the word “you” during domestic arguments.

Don’t let someone else’s urgency become your emergency. In fact, don’t be governed by the urgent of any sort. Focus on the important. The urgent is a tyrant. The important should be your king. Down with the tyranny of the urgent!

Fear is fueled by a lack of imagination. The antidote to fear is not bravery; it looks more like imagination.

Leave a gate behind you the way you first found it.

In 100 years a lot of what we take to be true now will be proved to be wrong, maybe even embarrassingly wrong. A good question to ask yourself today is “What might I be wrong about?” This is the only worry worth having.

Learn how to tie a bowline knot. Practice in the dark. With one hand. For the rest of your life you’ll use this knot more times than you would ever believe.

The greatest rewards come from working on something that nobody has words for. If you possibly can work where there are no names for what you do.

On the way to a grand goal celebrate the smallest victories as if each one were the final goal. That way, no matter where it ends you are victorious.

In all things—except love— start with the exit strategy. Prepare for the ending. Almost anything is easier to get into than out of.

Don’t aim to have others like you; aim to have them respect you.

The foundation of maturity: Just because it’s not your fault doesn’t mean it’s not your responsibility.

Compliment people behind their back. It’ll come back to you.

Each time you connect to people bring them a blessing; then they’ll be happy to see you when you bring them a problem.

The work on any worthy project is endless, infinite. You cannot limit the work so you must limit your hours. Your time, not the work is the only thing you can manage.

You can reduce the annoyance of someone’s stupid belief by increasing your understanding of why they believe it.

Children totally accept —and crave—family rules. “In our family we have a rule for X” is the only excuse a parent needs for setting a family policy. In fact, “I have a rule for X” is the only excuse you need for your own personal policies.

Bad things can happen fast but almost all good things happen slowly.

To succeed, get other people to pay you; to become wealthy, help other people to succeed.

Your behavior, not your opinions will change the world.

Do you keep dating new folks (explore) or try to commit to someone you met? The ideal balance for exploring new things vs. optimizing those already found is ⅓.
